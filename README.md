Set up, manage, and control your Houseflow devices, that includes connected home products like lights, cameras, thermostats, relays and more â€“ all from the Houseflow app.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

- [Houseflow](#houseflow)
  - [Get started](#get-started)
    - [Backend infrastructure](#backend-infrastructure)
        - [MQTT Broker](#mqtt-broker)
        - [Device service](#device-service)
        - [Webhooks service](#webhooks-service)
        - [Auth service](#auth-service)
        - [OTA service](#ota-service)
    - [Mobile App](#mobile-app)
    - [Web App](#web-app)
    - [Embedded devices](#embedded-devices)
    - [Firestore database](#firestore-database)

## Get started
There will be some steps added soon

### Backend infrastructure

1. [MQTT Broker](#mqtt-broker)
2. [Device service](#device-service)
3. [Auth service](#auth-service)
4. [OTA service](#ota-service)

##### MQTT Broker

Houseflow uses [emqx](https://github.com/emqx/emqx) as MQTT Broker. Devices connect to it aswell as [Device service](#device-service). For authorization [Auth service](#auth-service) is being used. It sends HTTP request to [Webhooks service](#webhooks-sevice) on every connect/disconnect

##### Device service
Used to handle all requests from Web or Mobile app, communicates with them over HTTP, for authorization it is using [Firestore](#firestore-database). Redirects all HTTP requests directly to [MQTT Broker](#mqtt-broker) with specific topic, in conclusion embedded device trigger specific event

##### Webhooks service
Listens to EMQX connect/disconnect events, changes device state in [Firestore](#firestore-database)

##### Auth service

Adds device and ACL authorization for MQTT broker, prevents devices from subscribing to topic which isn't intended for them and also from connecting unknown devices.

##### OTA service

~~Handle updates over the air for embedded devices~~. Currently not used. Updates are handled via ArduinoOTA, [related issue](https://github.com/gbaranski/houseflow/issues/128).

### Embedded devices

Currently supported devices are ESP8266, also there is a version in Node.JS. For ESP8266 I use Arduino framework and some kind of C++.

### Firestore database

Project is using [Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) for storing devices, users and etc
